# SageMaker Deployment Project

This is the first project of Udacity's Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree, we are using Pytorch to develop a neural network to predict if movie reviews are positive or negative using historical IMDB reviews dataset.

#### Project Status: Deployed

## Project Intro

The purpose of this project is to predict the sentiment of a movie review using a neural network but also to deploy it in Amazon AWS to have an API for predictions with a web-app.

### Methods used

- LTSM
- RNN
- CountVectorizer
- Bag of words
- Tokenization

### Technologies

- Jupyter Notebook (Sagemaker Notebook Instance)
- AWS Custom Models deployment
- AWS Sagemaker Endpoints
- AWS Lambda functions
- AWS API Gateway

## Notebooks
